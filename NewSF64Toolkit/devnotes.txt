File info:
I'm going to use this file to keep track of my current goals/progress. It will get messy.

Quick notation:
On goal lists, I use certain characters to notate progress.
! - Finished
~ - In progress/Incomplete
X - No longer needed/relevant
  - [No marker] Not started

List of priorities:
!1. Make the program load up the ROM and parse the information correctly.
2. Decide on how the program layout will look.
3. Add in next features based on easiness.

List of features:
!About page [Still needs actual about text]
!Load ROM
!Save ROM
!Load DMA
!Save DMA
~List DMA Files
!Expand ROM (should it automatically expand the rom upon opening? Probably not)
!Fix CRC
Better feedback to user on successes/failures
!Level Viewer
Model Viewer
Text editor (requires finding the pointers to the text, won't it? Will that work for all text in ALL the game??)

More notes:
-Organize tools that can be used by more than one rom into a generic n64 tools folder
