# NewSF64Toolkit
A Starfox 64 romhacking toolkit based off XDaniel's original SF64Toolkit

More info to come in the future, but essentially this tool will have all the functionality in the old SF64Toolkit, as well as a new model viewer. Will probably heavily rip off design elements from Hylian Toolbox/Banjo's Backpack/Toad's Tool. Also looking for a better name (like Slippy's Workshop), let me know if you can think of one.
